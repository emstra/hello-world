Here proposed, for development in the interest of a potential future pleasure and profit is the game of Ice Cream Truck. Ice Cream Truck is an action/ sim game where players take on the role of an ice cream truck operator. They serve ice cream and make money, which they then invest back into their ice cream truck. The tone of the game will be lighthearted, and silly. At no point will anyone die.

##Concept
Ice Cream Truck is the premium experience in learning how to scoop ice-cream. Players in this game are tasked with serving up the tastiest ice-cream treats to all the kiddos. If you fail to serve it up then you are fired, and if you succeed you continue playing until you are fired. It's fun! I swear! This game harkens back to the golden age of arcade games. Dig Dug? You bet. Tapper? Oh yeah. Centipede? Maybe, I never played that one. Ice Cream Scooper is a puzzle game mixed with a sim, where as you play you can upgrade your ice cream truck, buy new flavors and all around have fun making some gosh darn ice cream.
##Esthetics and Gameplay
Ice Cream Truck will have a cartoonish art style, which will match the light tone of the game. Control of the game will be given over predominantly to the mouse and wasd keys. The player will spend their time alternating between clicking through menus and serving ice cream, which is a more action oriented part of the game. In the menus players can buy new equipment for their truck. The action part plays out similar to tapper.
